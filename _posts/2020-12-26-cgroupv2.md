- Simple architecture
cgroup v2 focuses on simplicity: /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/$GROUPNAME and /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/$GROUPNAME in v1 are now unified as /sys/fs/cgroup/$GROUPNAME , and a process can no longer join different groups for different controllers. If the process joins foo ( /sys/fs/cgroup/foo ), all controllers enabled for foo will take the control of the process.
- eBPF-oriented
In cgroup v2, the device access control is implemented by attaching an eBPF program (BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_DEVICE)to the file descriptor of /sys/fs/cgroup/foo directory.
- rootless containers
Rootless containers allow running containers as a non-root user on the host to mitigate potential runtime vulnerabilities.

- docker 20 's main new feature is relying on cgroup v2.
