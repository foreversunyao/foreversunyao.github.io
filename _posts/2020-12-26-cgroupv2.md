- Simple architecture
cgroup v2 focuses on simplicity: /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/$GROUPNAME and /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/$GROUPNAME in v1 are now unified as /sys/fs/cgroup/$GROUPNAME , and a process can no longer join different groups for different controllers. If the process joins foo ( /sys/fs/cgroup/foo ), all controllers enabled for foo will take the control of the process.
- eBPF-oriented
In cgroup v2, the device access control is implemented by attaching an eBPF program (BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_DEVICE)to the file descriptor of /sys/fs/cgroup/foo directory.
- rootless containers
Rootless containers allow running containers as a non-root user on the host to mitigate potential runtime vulnerabilities.

- docker 20 's main new feature is relying on cgroup v2. 

[cgroup_cpuacct](https://theupbeat.github.io/posts/cgroups_2/)

- command
```
apt install libcgroup
lscgroup
```
- 12 cgroups
```
ls -l \sys\fs\cgroup\
blkio - Block I/O (or) set limits to read/write from/to.
cpu - Control CPU time using CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler).
cpuacct - Reports are generated regarding the usage of CPU resources by a process.
cpuset - Assings inividual CPUs and memory nodes to tasks (in a single cgroup).
devices - Allow/Deny access to devices.
freezer - Suspends/Resumes a process.
hugetlb - Allows/Denys the use of huge pages for a specific group.
memory - Set limits on usage for memory for a task/process.
net_cls - Allows to note/mark specific packets from a group.
net_prio - Set the priority dynamically to the network traffic.
perf_event - Allows access to a perf events to a group.
pids - To limit the number of process/tasks from being forked for cloned when a certain limit is reached.
