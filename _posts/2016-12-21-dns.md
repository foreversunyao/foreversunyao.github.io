**DNS zone**
A DNS zone is a distinct part of the domain name space, delegated to a specific legal entity which is responsible for managing it.
For example, a root domain such as “acme.com” is a DNS zone, which can be delegated to a company, Acme Corporation Inc. Acme Corporation then assumes responsibility for setting up a primary DNS server, called an Authoritative Name Server, which holds correct DNS records for that domain.
DNS zones exist at higher and lower levels of the DNS hierarchy. For example, the Top Level Domain “.com” is also a DNS zone, which has an Authoritative Name Server providing DNS records for all the domains in the “.com” namespace. A subdomain, such as “support.acme.com” is also a DNS zone, which can be managed by Acme Corporation, or delegated to another entity.

**Primary and Secondary DNS**
Primary (Master) DNS zone for control and Secondary (Slave) DNS zone for redundancy and better performance.
Primary DNS zone contains all the original DNS records and controll zone file.  This file contains the authoritative DNS information for the domain or subdomain. “Authoritative” means it is the trusted source for information like the IP address of the domain, administrator contact information, and settings like Time to Live. And the second gets them from the Primary DNS zone. The process is called DNS zone transfer. The Primary DNS server could push it, or the secondary can get the changes when its cache expires.
The Secondary DNS zone is a read-only copy of the zone data.

**DNS Zone VS .Domain**
In the domain namespace, the biggest difference between the domains and zones is that domains provide logical structure, and the zones provide an administrative structure. 
A domain is a subtree of the domain namespace. It shares its name with that of the top-most node, like yoursite.eu (eu domain). It could be divided into various zones that can be controlled separately.
