**Ingress**
Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services in the
cluster, mostly over HTTP/HTTPS , like a collection of routing rules that gaven how external users access services running in a Kubernetes cluster.

**Ingress Resources**
The ingress resource contains metadata configuration parameters for the third-party systems. These parameters include security policies, routing rules and traffic steering parameters. The ingress controller works with the ingress resource to automatically provision application delivery systems.
- example:
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /api/hello-world
        backend:
          serviceName: hello-world
          servicePort: 80
```

**Ingress Controllers**
The ingress controller is a Kubernetes service responsible for managing ingress network traffic. This is primarily accomplished by providing an interface between the Kubernetes environment and third-party ingress systems like network and security systems. These systems have proprietary management interfaces, so the ingress controller is also provided by the third-party vendor.
Monitor Ingress resources via the Kubernetes API and update the configuration of a load balancer in case of any changes.Acts as reverse proxy for the Ingress rules found at api-server’s /ingresses endpoint
There are multiple ways to access an Ingress Controller from outside of a cluster:
HostPorts - You can configure each pod to accept traffic on a host port
NodePorts - You can create a node port service to forward traffic to the IC from the service port on every node LoadBalancer - Cloud deployments can use LB services for forward traffic to the IC.
```
client  --> Ingress Controller(deployment, should be on multiple nodes with same ip and port, usually keepalived) --> ingress(rules) 
            --> service --> deployment(pod)
```

**Methods to route traffic**
[refer](https://www.weave.works/blog/kubernetes-faq-how-can-i-route-traffic-for-kubernetes-on-bare-metal)
- proxy + clusterIP
- NodePort
- Ingress
- Load Balncer

**metallb**
[refer](https://www.objectif-libre.com/en/blog/2019/06/11/metallb/)
MetalLB is a Loadbalancer implementation for bare metal Kubernetes clusters, based on standard routing protocols.
For this a network address pool must be reserved for MetalLB. Once MetalLB has assigned an external IP address to a service, it needs to redirect the traffic from the external IP to the cluster. To do so, MetalLB uses standard protocols such as ARP, NDP, or BGP.
- configMap
**Each service** will pick **one IP** from ConfigMap's data.config.address-pools.addresses. The IP here should be **external ip** and not used by any other host.
So every TOR should send request to hosts(which are peered) and the kube-proxy on these hosts can resolve this vip to specific service.


- controller
Deployment, get config from configMap, this component is responsible for receiving allocation requests.
- speaker
DaemonSet, get config from configMap, the speaker must be installed on each node in the cluster to advertise ip address

- traffic flow(metallb)
IP address --> TOR switches --> peer hosts(nodes) -->  kube-proxy(find k8s service by IP and then find pods by selector) 

- example
```
kubectl get svc -n ingress-services
