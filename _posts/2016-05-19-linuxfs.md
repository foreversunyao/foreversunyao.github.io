**File System**

![img]({{ '/assets/images/linux/Linux-file-system-type.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*(°0°)*

ext4 tuning: 
noatime(no access timestamp),noatime > relatime > atime
nobarrier(Write barriers enforce proper on-disk ordering of journal commits, making volatile disk write caches safe to use, at some performance penalty)
writeback(only metadata being journaled, but not actual file data)

**File Directory**

![img]({{ '/assets/images/linux/Linux-directory.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*(°0°)*


**Permission**
1. permission groups: owner,group,all users
2. permission types: read,write,execute
3. ls -l
```
_rwxrwxrwx 1 owner:groups
# the first character is a special permission flag
# others are for owner,group and users
# <1> number of hardlinks to the file
# owner:group
```
4. chmod , chmod a-rw file1
```
u – Owner
g – Group
o – Others
a – All users
+ plus
- minus
r – Read
w – Write
x – Execute
r = 4
w = 2
x = 1
```
5. advanced permissions
```
_ – no special permissions
d – directory
l– The file or directory is a symbolic link
s – This indicated the setuid/setgid permissions. This is not set displayed in the special permission part of the permissions display, but is represented as a s in the read portion of the owner or group permissions.
t – This indicates the sticky bit permissions. This is not set displayed in the special permission part of the permissions display, but is represented as a t in the executable portion of the all users permissions
```
The setuid/setguid permissions are used to tell the system to run an executable as the owner with the owner’s permissions.
The sticky bit can be very useful in shared environment because when it has been assigned to the permissions on a directory it sets it so only file owner can rename or delete the said file.
6. important files
home directory 700
bootloader configuration files 700
system and daemon config files 644
firewall scripts 700
