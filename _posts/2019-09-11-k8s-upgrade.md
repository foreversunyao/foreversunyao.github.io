Basically, there are **four** steps need to follow: 
- checking precondition 
- upgrading control plane nodes 
- upgrading worker nodes
- verify cluster status.*

**How does it work**

> kubeadm upgrade apply

- Checks that your cluster is in an upgradeable state:
    The API server is reachable
    All nodes are in the Ready state
    The control plane is healthy
- Enforces the version skew policies.
- Makes sure the control plane images are available or available to pull to the machine.
- Upgrades the control plane components or rollbacks if any of them fails to come up.
- Applies the new kube-dns and kube-proxy manifests and makes sure that all necessary RBAC rules are created.
- Creates new certificate and key files of the API server and backs up old files if theyâ€™re about to expire in 180 days.

> kubeadm upgrade node on control plane nodes:
- Fetches the kubeadm ClusterConfiguration from the cluster.
- Optionally backups the kube-apiserver certificate.
- Upgrades the static Pod manifests for the control plane components.
- Upgrades the kubelet configuration for this node.

> kubeadm upgrade node on worker nodes:
- Fetches the kubeadm ClusterConfiguration from the cluster.
- Upgrades the kubelet configuration for this node.
