**What is Helm**
[git](https://github.com/helm/helm)
Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.
Helm - apt
Charts - debian package

[history](https://helm.sh/blog/helm-3-preview-pt1/)

**Helm concepts**
Helm is organized around several key concepts:
A chart is a package of pre-configured Kubernetes resources
A release is a specific instance of a chart which has been deployed to the cluster using Helm
A repository is a group of published charts which can be made available to others

**Helm components**
- Helm Client - allows developers to create new charts, manage chart repositories, and interact with the tiller server.
- Tiller Server - runs inside the Kubernetes cluster. Interacts with Helm client, and translates chart definitions and configuration to Kubernetes API commands. Tiller combines a chart and its configuration to build a release. Tiller is also responsible for upgrading charts, or uninstalling and deleting them from the Kubernetes cluster.
