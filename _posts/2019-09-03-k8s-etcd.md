**etcd**
Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes’ backing store for all cluster data.

**etcd backup&resotre**
[refer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/#backing-up-an-etcd-cluster)
```
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints $ENDPOINT snapshot save snapshotdb
# exit 0

# verify the snapshot
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --write-out=table snapshot status snapshotdb
```

**TLS**
▪ etcd supports encrypted communication through TLS
▪ TLS can be used between peers and clients 
▪ To start a cluster with TLS each cluster member should have:
▪ ca-client.crt: the CA (certificate authority) trusted by the server to sign client certs
▪ Only used to auth clients if the --client-cert-auth switch is set, else any client can connect
▪ node-client.crt: the server public key certificate signed by a CA for use with clients
▪ node-client.key: the server private key for use with clients
▪ ca-peer.crt: the CA trusted by the server to sign peer certs
▪ Only used to auth peers if the --peer-client-cert-auth switch is set, else any peer can
connect
▪ node-peer.crt: the server public key certificate signed by a CA for use with peers
▪ node-peer.key: private key associated with the node-peer.crt for use with peers
