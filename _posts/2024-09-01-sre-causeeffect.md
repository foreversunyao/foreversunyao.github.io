# cause and effect
"SRE cause and effect" refers to the relationship between an action or event ("cause") and the resulting outcome or consequence ("effect") within the field of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE); essentially, it means understanding how specific actions, like a code change or system configuration, can directly lead to either positive or negative impacts on the reliability and performance of a system. 


# Key points about SRE cause and effect:
## Identifying causes:
SRE practitioners actively monitor system behavior and analyze logs to pinpoint potential causes of issues like performance degradation, outages, or unexpected errors. 
## Predicting effects:
Once a cause is identified, SREs can use their understanding of system architecture and dependencies to predict the potential downstream effects of a change or incident. 
## Proactive mitigation:
By analyzing cause-and-effect relationships, SREs can implement preventive measures to address potential issues before they impact users, such as implementing automated alerts or conducting risk assessments. 

# Example of SRE cause and effect:
Cause: Deploying a new software update with a memory leak.
Effect: Increased system resource usage, leading to slow response times and potential system crashes.
