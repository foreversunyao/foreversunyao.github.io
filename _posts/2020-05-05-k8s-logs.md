**Logging Architecture**
[refer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/)
Docker containers in Kubernetes write logs to standard output (stdout) and standard (stderr) error streams. Docker redirects these streams to a logging driver configured in Kubernetes to write to a file in JSON format. Kubernetes then exposes log files to users via kubectl logs command. Users can also get logs from a previous instantiation of a container setting the --previous flag of this command to true. That way they can get container logs if the container crashed and was restarted.

**Ways**
- using a logging sidecar container running inside an appâ€™s pod (different sidecars for different app)
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example
    image: busybox
    args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - >
      while true;
      do
        echo "$(date)\n" >> /var/log/example.log;
        sleep 1;
      done
    volumeMounts:
    - name: varlog
      mountPath: /var/log
  - name: sidecar
    image: busybox
    args: [/bin/sh, -c, 'tail -f /var/log/example.log']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: varlog
      mountPath: /var/log
  volumes:
  - name: varlog
    emptyDir: {}
```
- using a node-level logging agent that runs on every node (only works for stdout/stderr)
```
/var/log/containers
```
- push logs directly from within an application to some backend(X)
- 

**Best pratice**
- container logs should have a separate shipper, storage, and lifecycle that are independent of pods and nodes
