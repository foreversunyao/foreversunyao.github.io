OpenTracing Standard:

 - Tracer – knows how to create a new span as well as inject/extract span contexts across process boundaries. All OpenTracing compatible tracers must provide a client with the implementation of the Tracer interface.
 - Span – tracer’s build method yields a brand new created span. We can invoke a number of operations after the span has been started, like aggregating tags, changing span’s operation name, binding references to other spans, adding baggage items, etc.
 - SpanContext – the consumers of the API only interact with this type when injecting/extracting the span context from the transport protocol.
