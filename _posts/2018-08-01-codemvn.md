**Mvn**
Maven is a "build management tool", it is for defining how your .java files get compiled to .class, packaged into .jar (or .war or .ear) files, (pre/post)processed with tools, managing your CLASSPATH, and all others sorts of tasks that are required to build your project.

**Command**
```
mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.5.4 (1edded0938998edf8bf061f1ceb3cfdeccf443fe; 2018-06-18T02:33:14+08:00)

**Build Lifecycle**
Each of these build lifecycles is defined by a different list of build phases, wherein a build phase represents a stage in the lifecycle.

For example, the default lifecycle comprises of the following phases (for a complete list of the lifecycle phases, refer to the Lifecycle Reference):

 - validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
 - compile - compile the source code of the project
 - test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
 - package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
 - integration-test: process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be run.
 - verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
 - install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
 - deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects

 - clean: cleans up artifacts created by prior builds
 - site: generates site documentation for this project
**pom.xml**
project- It is the root elment of the pom.xml file.
modelVersion- modelversion means what version of the POM model you are using. Use version 4.0.0 for maven 2 and maven 3.
groupId- groupId means the id for the project group. It is unique and Most often you will use a group ID which is similar to the root Java package name of the project like we used the groupId com.project.loggerapi.
artifactId- artifactId used to give name of the project you are building.in our example name of our project is LoggerApi.
version- version element contains the version number of the project. If your project has been released in different versions then it is useful to give version of your project.
dependencies- dependencies element is used to defines a list of dependency of project.
dependency- dependency defines a dependency and used inside dependencies tag. Each dependency is described by its groupId, artifactId and version.
name- this element is used to give name to our maven project.
scope- this element used to define scope for this maven project that can be compile, runtime, test, provided system etc.
packaging- packaging element is used to packaging our project to output types like JAR, WAR etc.
