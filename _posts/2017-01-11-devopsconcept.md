**Three Ways of DevOps**

 - Workflow:

Ensure each step is done in a repeatable way.
Never pass defects to the next step.
Ensure no local optimizations degrade global performance.
Increase the flow of work.

 - Improve Feedback:

Understand and respond to all customers, internal and external.
Shorten feedback loops.
Amplify all feedback.
Embed knowledge where it is needed.

 - Continual Experimentation and Learning:

Rituals are created that reward risk taking.
Management allocates time for projects that improve the system.
Faults are introduced into the system to increase resilience.
You try "crazy" or audacious things.


**The Eight Principles of Continuous Delivery**

1.The process for releasing/deploying must be repeatable and reliable.
2.Automate everything.
3.If something is difficult or painful, do it more often to improve and automate it.
4.Keep everything in source control.
5."Done" means "released, working properly, in the hands of the end user."
6.Build quality in.
7.Everybody has responsibility for the release process.
8.Improve continuously.
