# General Concept
* AI: Artificial Intelligence 
* Machine Learning: Machine find a pattern and predict 
* Deep Learnining: using netural network, input layers + multi hidden layers + output layer, like what our brain think 
* Generative AI: using some foundation models, like LLM, audio model, video models..
* LLM: Large language Model 
* Scaling Laws: Compute, Dataset Size, Parameters. Test Cross-Entropy Loss
* GPU: compute parallel, float compute

# LLM
Large language models, also known as LLMs, are very large deep learning models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data. The underlying transformer is a set of neural networks that consist of an encoder and a decoder with self-attention capabilities. The encoder and decoder extract meanings from a sequence of text and understand the relationships between words and phrases in it.

# Benefits

* Versatility of applications
* Human productivity boost
* Natural language understanding
* Interactive at scale
* Task-specific without fine-tuning
