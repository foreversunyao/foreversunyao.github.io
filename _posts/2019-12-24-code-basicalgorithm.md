## what is algorithm
a few logical steps to solve specific calculate problem
## what is data structure
a way to organise, manage and store data, which make it can be accessed and modified effectively
## the ways to evaluate algorithm
1. time complexity
basic operation times
O(1)
O(logN)
O(n)
O(nlogN)
O(n^2)
2. space complexity
mem used for store temporary data
O(1) constant, no relation with input size
O(n), Linear
O(n^2),
recursion -> O(depth of recursion)

## basic data structure
1. array
- retrieve element by index in O(1) time
- insert/delete need to move elements in O(n) time
- O(n) space complexity
2. linked list
- not consecutive on space
- each node has two parts(data and next pointer)
- tail node's next pointer is NULL
- retrieve node one by one, O(n) time
- only insert/delete operation takes O(1) time
3. stack
4. queue
