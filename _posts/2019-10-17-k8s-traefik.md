**Traefik**
Traefik is an open-source Edge Router that makes publishing your services a fun and easy experience. It receives requests on behalf of your system and finds out which components are responsible for handling them.

 - Ingress objects are the rules that define the routes to our services. It's like a proxy config ?
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: whoami-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik
spec:
  rules:
  - host: whoami.localhost
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: whoami-service
          servicePort: http
```
 - Ingress controllers , Now that you have defined the rules to access your services from the outside, all you need is a component that routes the incoming requests according to the rules … and these components are called Ingress Controllers!
 - Traefik work as ingress controller, read INGRESS(rules) to know where to route the requests

**Traefik vs Haproxy/Nginx**

Traefik is a rather young project squarely aimed at those running their applications in orchestrated containers. It’s a load balancer that goes hand in hand with service discovery methods and tools, reload-less reconfiguration, modern metrics and monitoring, all the goodies that are essential when behind a nice frontend may hide hundreds of small (should I say micro?) services.

**Metallb vs Ingress**

**middlewares**
[ref](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/overview/)
Attached to the routers, pieces of middleware are a means of tweaking the requests before they are sent to your service (or before the answer from the services are sent to the clients).

There are several available middleware in Traefik, some can modify the request, the headers, some are in charge of redirections, some add authentication, and so on.
