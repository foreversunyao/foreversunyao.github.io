**Distributions**
Linux works differently. The Linux operating system isn’t produced by a single organization. Different     organizations and people work on different parts. There’s the Linux kernel (the core of the operating s    ystem), the GNU shell utilities (the terminal interface and many of the commands you use), the X server     (which produces a graphical desktop), the desktop environment (which runs on the X server to provide a g    raphical desktop), and more. Linux distributions do the hard work for you, taking all the code from the open-source projects and compiling it for you, combining it into a single operating system you can boot up and install.  When you want to install new software or update to new versions of software with important security updates, your Linux distribution provides them in precompiled, packaged form.

**Path**
```
sudo apt-get update
/etc/apt/sources.list.d
```

**DebianRepository**
[refer](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format)
- sources.list
```
deb uri distribution [component1] [component2] [...]
```
- dists:  distribution 
- pool: archive root

**dh_make**
```
dh_make -f source.tar.gz
```

**Debian Build**

```
RUN mk-build-deps -t "apt-get -y --no-install-recommends" -i "debian/control"
RUN dpkg-buildpackage
RUN for deb in ../*.deb; do dpkg-deb --contents "$deb"; done \
    && lintian --profile xxxx ../*.changes
```

**Debian testing**
Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian policy as well as some checks for common errors
```
lintian path/to/pkg_version_arch.changes
```

**list content**
```
dpkg-deb -c <package_name.deb>
