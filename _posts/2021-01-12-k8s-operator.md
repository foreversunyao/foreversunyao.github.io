**Why Operator**
for stateful applications which need preparation and post-provisioning steps

**What is Operator**
â€œAn operator is a way of building an application and driving an application on top of Kubernetes, behind Kubernetes APIs.

**Componenets**
An operator consists of two things:
One or more Kubernetes custom resource definitions, or CRDs. These describe to Kubernetes a new kind of resource, including what fields it should have. There may be multiple, for example etcd-cluster-operator has both EtcdCluster and EtcdPeer to encapsulate different concepts.
A running piece of software that reads the custom resources, and acts in response, usually a controller

**Pros**
- Kubernetes Operators allow developers to easily extend Kubernetes functionality for specific software [and] use cases
- Operators do this in a scalable, repeatable, standardized fashion
- Operators systematize human knowledge as code

**Cons**
- more code need to maintain


**example**
