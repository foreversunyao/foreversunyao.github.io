**Some concepts**

Automation refers to doing things without human intervention. Automation is great for doing repetitive things because machines are less likely to make mistakes compared to people.
Orchestration refers to coordinating automated tasks. This is useful if you have some tasks that depend on other tasks to work properly, or if you have to do these tasks simultaneously by multiple machines.
Self-healing
In software systems, the self-healing term describes any application, service, or a system that can discover that it is not working correctly and, without any human intervention, make the necessary changes to restore itself to the normal or designed state.The goal is to make fault tolerant and responsive system capable of responding to changes in demand and recuperation from failures.
Auto-scale
Auto Scaling is the ability to automatically adjust resources in your Cloud based on load. You can increase resources when they are needed or decrease resources when they are no longer needed.
