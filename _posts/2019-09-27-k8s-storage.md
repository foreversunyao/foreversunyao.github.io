**StorageClass**
storage define

**PVC**
storage declarative and claim

**PV**
storage instance

**StatefulSet**
Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods , and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.  These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.

**Container Storage Interface**
The Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a standard for exposing arbitrary block and file storage systems to containerized workloads on Container Orchestration Systems (COs) like Kubernetes. Using CSI third-party storage providers can write and deploy plugins exposing new storage systems in Kubernetes without ever having to touch the core Kubernetes code.

**Rook**
Storage orchestrator, rook turns storage software into self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services.  It does this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management. Rook uses the facilities provided by the underlying cloud-native container management, scheduling and orchestration platform to perform its duties.
