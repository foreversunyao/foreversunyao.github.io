## paging vs swapping
[refer](https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-swapping-and-paging/)
In swapping, the processes move back and forth between the main memory and secondary memory. In paging, equal size memory blocks, called pages, move between the main memory and secondary memory.
While swapping is suitable for heavy workloads, paging is suitable for small to medium workloads.
Swapping helps the CPU to access processes faster while paging helps to implement virtual memory.
