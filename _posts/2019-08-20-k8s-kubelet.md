**kubelet**
Basically, it’s an agent that runs on each node and is responsible for watching the API Server for pods that are bound to its node and making sure those pods are running (it talks to the Docker daemon using the API over the Docker socket to manipulate containers lifecycle). It then reports back to the API Server the status of changes regarding those pods.

The main Kubelet responsibilities include:
- Run the pods containers.
- Report the status of the node and each pod to the API Server.
- Run container probes.
- Retrieve container metrics from cAdvisor, aggregate and expose them through the Kubelet Summary API for components (such as Heapster) to consume.

**10250**
The kubelet serves a small REST API on ports 10250 and 10255. Port 10250 is a read/write port, whilst 10255 is a read-only port with a subset of the API endpoints.
