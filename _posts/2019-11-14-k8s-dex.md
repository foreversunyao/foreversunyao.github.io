**OpenID Connect Tokens**
OpenID Connect is a flavor of OAuth2 supported by some OAuth2 providers, notably Azure Active Directory, Salesforce, and Google. The protocol’s main extension of OAuth2 is an additional field returned with the access token called an ID Token. This token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) with well known fields, such as a user’s email, signed by the server.
To identify the user, the authenticator uses the id_token (not the access_token) from the OAuth2 token response as a bearer token. See above for how the token is included in a request.

```
The user initiates a login request in the dex-k8s-authenticator (login.k8s.example.com)
dex-k8s-authenticator redirects the request to Dex (dex.k8s.example.com)
Dex redirects to the GitHub authorization page
GitHub encrypts the corresponding information and passes it back to Dex
Dex forwards this information to dex-k8s-authenticator
The user gets the OIDC token from GitHub
dex-k8s-authenticator adds the token to kubeconfig
kubectl passes the token to KubeAPIServer
KubeAPIServer returns the result to kubectl
The user gets the information from kubectl
```
