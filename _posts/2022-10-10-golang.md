# advantages:
- Runs fast
- Garbage collection
- Simpler objects
- efficient concurrency
- compiled language

# OOP
- encapsulation : data + func


# Go syntax
- structs (like class in java) , no inheritance/no constructors/no generics
- workspaces, three subdirectories (src, pkg and bin), workspace is defined by GOPATH env variable
- packages: group of related source files, can be imported by othr packages
```
package p1
package p2
import ( "p1", "p2" )
```
- main package, main() where the code execution starts
- import: access other packages; will search directories in GOROOT and GOPATH
- go build -> complies the program
- go doc -> prints documentation for a package
- go fmt -> formats source code files
- go get -> download packages and installs them
- go list -> lists all installed packages
- go run -> compiles .go files and runs the executable
- go test -> runs tests using files ending in "_test.go"
- variables -> must have a name and a type, declarations
```
var x,y int
```
- variable types : integer, floating point, strings, 

# Concurrency
- difficulties
when do tasks start/stop
what if one task needs data from another task
do tasks conflict in memory


# Basics
- pointers 
a pointer is an address to data in the memory
& operator returns the address of a variable/function
* operator returns data at an address(dereferencing)
new() function creates a variable and returns a pointer to the variable
```
var x int = 1
var y int
var ip *int
ip = &x
y = *ip
ptr := new(int)
*ptr = 3
```

- variable scope
the places in code where a variable can be accessed
blocks {}
hierarchy of implicit blocks
universe block -> all go source
package block -> all source in package
file block -> all source in a file
if, for, switch

- deallocating space
when a variable is no longer needed, it should be deallocated, otherwise we will eventually run out of memory
stack(function calls, deallocate after func done) vs heap(persistent)

- garbage collection(why it's fast)
Hard to determine when a variable is no longer in use
```
func foo() *int {
 x :=1
 return &x
}
func main() {
 var y *int
 y = foo()
 fmt.Printf("%d", *y)
}
```
Go is a complied language which enables garbage collection
Compiler determines stack vs heap
Garbage collection in the background



- comments, printing and integers
comments // or /* */
fmt.Printf("Hi %s", x)
integers

- Type conversions
Most binary oeprations need operands of the same type
```
var x int32 =1
var y int16 =2
x = y
x = int32(y)
```

- String packages
runes are divied into many different categories
provides a set of functions to test categories of runes
```
IsDigit(r rune)
IsSpace(r rune)
IsLetter(r rune)
ToUpper(r rune)
Compare(a,b)
Atoi(s)
```
Strings are immutable, but modified strings(new strings) are returned

- Constants
expression whose value is known at compile time
```
const ( y = 4, x='abc')
```
Constants must be different but actual value is not important, each constant is assigned to a unique integer
Starts at 1 and increments
```
type Grades int
const (
 A Grades = iota
 B
 C
 D
 F
)
```

- Control flow
```
if else
switch/case
for i:=0; i<10;i ++ {
	fmt.Printf("hi ")
}
break and continue
scan
```
Scan reads user input and takes a pointer as an argument, typed data is written to ponter, returns number of scanned items
```
fmt.Printf("Number of apples")
num, err := fmt.Scan(&appleNum)
fmt.Printf(appleNum)
```

- Composite datatypes
Arrays: Fixed-length series of elements of a chosen type
... for size in array literal infers size from number of initializers
```
var x [5]int
x[0]=2
fmt.Printf(x[1])
var x [5]int = [5]{1,2,3,4,5}
for i, v range x {
  fmt.Printf("ind %x value %y",i,v)
}
```
Slices: A window on an underlying array
Variable size, up to whole array
Pointer, Length, Capacity
```
arr := [...]string{"a","b","c"}
sli1 := x[0:1]
```
Make: make() create a slice and array using make()
```
sli = make([]int, 10)
sli = make([]int, 10, 15)
```
Append: Size of a slice can be increased by append()

HashTable:  Contains key/value pairs
Tradeoffs:
advantages:
Faster lookup than list, constant time vs linear-time
Arbitrary keys: Not ints, like slices or arrays
disadvantages:
may have collisions

Maps: implementation of Hashtable
```
var idMap map[string]int
idMap = make(map[string]int))
idMap := map[string]int {"joe":123}
id, p := idMap["joe"] //id is value, p is presence of key
for key, val "= range idMap { fmt.Println(key, val)}
```

Struct: aggregate data type
Person Struct: Name, Address, phone
```
type struct Person {
  name string
  addr string
  phone string
}
var p1 Person
p1.name = "joe"
x=p1.addr

p1 := new(Person)
p1 := Person(name:"Joe", addr: "a st.", phone: "123")

```

- Protocols and Formats
Requests for Comments (RFC): Definitions of Internet protocols and formats
Golang provides packages for important RFCs, Functions which encode and decode protocol format
```
http.Get(wwww.google.com)
net.Dial("tcp","google.com:80")
```

- JSON: atrribute-value format
All Unicode
Human-readable
Fairly compact representation
Types can be combined resursively(Array of struts, struct in struct)

JSON marshalling -> generating JSON representation from an object
JSON unmarshalling -> converts a JSON []byte into a Go object

- Files
Linear acces, not random access
Open, Read, Write, Close, Seek
```
dat, e := ioutil.ReadFile("test.txt") // dat is []byte filled with contents of entire file

dat = "Hello, world"
err := ioutil.WriteFile("outfile.txt", dat, 0777)
```

- os Package File Access
```
os.Open()
os.Close()
os.Read()  // control the amount read
os.Write()

f, err := os.Open("dt.txt")
barr := make([]byte, 10)
nb, err := f.Read(barr)
f.Close()

f, err := os.Create("outfile.txt")
barr := []byte{1,2,3}
nb, err := f.Write(barr)
nb, err := f.WriteString("Hi")

```
