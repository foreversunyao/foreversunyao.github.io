# advantages:
- Runs fast
- Garbage collection
- Simpler objects
- efficient concurrency
- compiled language

# OOP
- encapsulation : data + func


# Go syntax
- structs (like class in java) , no inheritance/no constructors/no generics
- workspaces, three subdirectories (src, pkg and bin), workspace is defined by GOPATH env variable
- packages: group of related source files, can be imported by othr packages
```
package p1
package p2
import ( "p1", "p2" )
```
- main package, main() where the code execution starts
- import: access other packages; will search directories in GOROOT and GOPATH
- go build -> complies the program
- go doc -> prints documentation for a package
- go fmt -> formats source code files
- go get -> download packages and installs them
- go list -> lists all installed packages
- go run -> compiles .go files and runs the executable
- go test -> runs tests using files ending in "_test.go"
- variables -> must have a name and a type, declarations
```
var x,y int
```
- variable types : integer, floating point, strings, 

# Concurrency
- difficulties
when do tasks start/stop
what if one task needs data from another task
do tasks conflict in memory
